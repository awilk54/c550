For this lab 1 exercise, we were to implement a simple UDP-based client-server system with limited security features. This Lab 1 exercise has two objectives: (i) help you get familiarized with Linux socket programming; (ii) experiment with packet sniffing and pcap analysis using Wireshark; practice the fundamentals of TCP/IP communications and handshake; and (iv) prepare you to tackle the next Lab assignment which involves the design of a more secure client server system.
